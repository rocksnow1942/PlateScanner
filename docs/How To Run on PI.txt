1. install pylibdmtx
on raspbian: "sudo apt-get install libdmtx0b"
then pip3 install pylibdmtx

2. How to solve timeout not working on pylibdmtx
Edit file: ~/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pylibdmtx/wrapper.py

The reason is a wrong c structure wrapper in class DmtxTime on Raspberry Pi arm platform.
On Raspberry Pi time_t is an long int and therefore can be ctype c_ulong instead of c_ulonglong.
Original code from wrapper.py:

class DmtxTime(Structure):
    _fields_ = [
        ('sec', c_ulonglong),      # Actually a time_t
        ('usec', c_ulong),
    ]

Working code on Raspberry Pi:

class DmtxTime(Structure):
    _fields_ = [
        ('sec', c_ulong),      # Actually a time_t
        ('usec', c_ulong),
    ]

2. install pyzbar
brew install zbar 
sudo apt install libzbar0
pip install pyzbar

2. If need openCV

I suppose there's no pre-built library for Raspberry Pi. So you can build it by yourself. Here is the source code:
Install OpenCV

3. change mouse cursor hide.

One option would be to install unclutter.

sudo apt update
sudo apt install unclutter

unclutter -idle 0

The mouse pointer will appear when moved.

The command can be put in autostart

/etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart

mouse double click speed:
